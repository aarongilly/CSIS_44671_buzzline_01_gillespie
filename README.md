This project introduces streaming data. 
The Python language includes generators - we'll use this feature to generate some streaming buzzline messages. 
As the code runs, it will continuously update the log file. 
We'll use a consumer to monitor the log file and alert us when a special message is detected. 

## Task 1: Create a Unique Producer

For this I went with simulating dice rolls. Not very unique, I know, but a throwback to a coding assignment I got a decade ago.

## Task 2: Create a Unique Consumer

The consumer script will analyze the logs generated by the producer, looking for a particular value, and create an alert for a specific value.

## Task 3: Update the README.md

Done!

## Running the Code

In VS Code, open a terminal. We'll run the producer first, then open a second terminal to run the consumer.

### Producer 
Use the commands below to activate .venv, and run the generator as a module. 

Windows PowerShell:

```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m producers.dice_roll_gillespie
```

Mac/Linux:
```zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m producers.dice_roll_gillespie
```

### Consumer

In VS Code, open a NEW terminal in your root project folder. 
Use the commands below to activate .venv, and run the file as a module. 

Windows:
```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m consumers.dice_consumer_gillespie
```

Mac/Linux:
```zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m consumers.dice_consumer_gillespie
```

## Save Space
To save disk space, you can delete the .venv folder when not actively working on this project.
We can always recreate it, activate it, and reinstall the necessary packages later. 
Managing Python virtual environments is a necessary and valuable skill. 
We will get a good amount of practice.
